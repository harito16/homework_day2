              <h2>Mouse Hunting</h2>
              <p>It was Sunday morning when my owner realized there was a mouse in the house. It was my 7th day off but I decided I was going to help him anyways. You're not going to believe what happened next...</br></br>He chased the mouse around the house for hours with a broom, unbelievable!&#x1F64A;. He hit him a couple of times, that's when I decided I was jump in and help him. </br></br> When the little mouse saw me, he freaked out and just fell dead. I got him with my mouth and took him out of the house. </br></br> It was a great hunt! &#X1F400; </p>

              <h2>Sleeping Marathon</h2>
              <p>After 6 short months of vacation I decided I needed to do some work. </br></br>A friend of mine had mention this sleeping marathon where you needed to sleep for 2 days straight, such hard work. I signed up for it! </br></br>I practiced for 6 long months. It was really diffcult, specially with Oddie, the dog, inside the house. One day I was about to break my 2 day record when he started barking, and for what, some silly dog treats.</br></br>Eventually my training paid off, I won the Sleeping Marathon and broke the record by sleeping for 3 straight days.</p>&#X1F43E;

              <h2>Lazyness Contest</h2>
              <p>I know what you're thinking but this contest is completely different to the Sleepign Marathon. In this contest you don't sleep, that's the difficult part. </br></br>In this contest you win by doing everything in a lazy way, if you're not a cat you won't be able to understand the rules of the game.</br></br>Anyways, I won this contest too. As you can see my work ethic is over the top </p>
